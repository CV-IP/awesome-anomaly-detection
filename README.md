> Inherit the idea of Anomaly Detection in Dynamic Networks using Multi-view Time-Series Hypersphere Learning, using an extra layer to separate anomaly instances among normal instance.

- [Deep One-Class Classification](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/ruff18a/ruff18a.pdf) - ICML 2018 Oral.
> A well written paper, sold a excellent story, but this paper **didn't** cited Anomaly Detection in Dynamic Networks using Multi-view Time-Series Hypersphere Learning, which inherited the same idea but published earlier than Deep One-Class Classification. I doubt the level of nnovelty in this paper though it was presented as oral paper in ICML 2018. Additionally, i have read carefully to the codes that were made public by author, **the implementation on the loss function of SVDD are different from what they claimed in paper**.

## One-Class Classification

- [One-Class SVMs for Document Classification](http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume2/manevitz01a/manevitz01a.pdf) - JMLR 2001.

## Hybrid

## Anomaly Detection Application

### KPI
- [Unsupervised Anomaly Detection via Variational Auto-Encoder for Seasonal KPIs in Web Applications](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.03903) - WWW 2018.
### Log

- [DeepLog: Anomaly Detection and Diagnosis from System Logs through Deep Learning](https://acmccs.github.io/papers/p1285-duA.pdf) - CCS 2017. 
> This is the first paper apply deep learning method to detect anomaly in log data. However, there are some obvious flaws in the experiment(i.e. The number of log templates are small, yet the top 10 predicted templates are used as true predications. Additionally, the author refuesed to share more details about there model.)
